## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (20+ recommended)
- Firebase project + Firebase CLI (`npm i -g firebase-tools`)
- Google AI Studio API Key (optional but recommended for AI features)

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables (AI)
Create a `.env` in project root:
```bash
# Google AI (Gemini) key for request assist features
VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```
Notes:
- If omitted, AI features simulate outputs so the app still works for demo/development.

### Firebase Configuration
Update `src/lib/firebase.js` with your Firebase config (Auth + Firestore). Example:
```js
// src/lib/firebase.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth, GoogleAuthProvider } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```
Then:
- Enable Google provider in Firebase Auth.
- Create a Firestore database.

### Firestore Rules & Indexes
Deploy included rules and indexes:
```bash
firebase login
firebase use <your-project-id>
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

Rules cover:
- `users` (public read, self write)
- `requests` (+ nested `responses`)
- `chats` (participants-only access for read/update/create)
- `notifications` (recipient-only access)

Indexes optimize `chats`, `requests`, `notifications` queries.

## üß™ Development

- Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

- Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

- Preview production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

- Lint:
```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### Firebase Hosting (configured)
`firebase.json` serves the Vite build (`dist`) with SPA rewrites:
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Vercel / Netlify
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output dir: `dist`
- Add `VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` in project settings

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- Keep secrets out of source control. The sample Firebase config in `src/lib/firebase.js` should be updated to your project; consider migrating to environment variables in production builds.
- Firestore security rules restrict sensitive operations; deploy before real usage.
- Web Share API uses native OS share sheet where available.

---

## üß† AI Features (Gemini)

- Tag suggestions for requests
- Clarity tips (concise, actionable bullet points)
- Request quality scores (clarity, specificity, likelihood)
- Optional description enhancement (adds `<placeholder>` only when needed)
- Simulation fallback allows continued use without a key

Env: GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY = <your key>
